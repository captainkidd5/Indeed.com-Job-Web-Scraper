# Indeed.com-Job-Web-Scraper
A python script automating job searching on Indeed.com



## **<u>Usage</u>**

From command line, navigate to the main folder. 

Head over to Indeed.com and enter your city in the search bar and copy the link you get once you've searched. It should look something like this: <https://www.indeed.com/l-Portland,-OR-jobs.html> **Make sure your link ending ends with .html**



In the command line, use this command to search for jobs:  ```webscraper.py Url``` where Url is the link above. This will give you a simple list of job postings with extraneous data filtered out. 

If you want to search for a specific term, simply append an argument with the given search term (not case-sensitive)



Happy job hunting!
